                <h2>Indus Valley Civilization</h2>
                <h3>&#8594;Introduction to the Indus Valley Civilization</h3>
                <p>The Indus Valley Civilization (IVC), also known as the Harappan Civilization, is one of the world's oldest urban cultures, flourishing from 3300 BCE to 1300 BCE, with its peak during 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE. It developed along the Indus River and its tributaries, covering an area that spans modern-day Pakistan, northwest India, and parts of Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>The discovery of the Indus Valley Civilization in the early 20th century revealed that it was a highly advanced and sophisticated society for its time. It was marked by large, well-planned cities, efficient water management systems, a complex social organization, and active trade networks. Cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro showcase the remarkable urban planning of this civilization, with broad streets arranged in a grid pattern, advanced drainage systems, and impressive public buildings.</p>

                <h3>&#8594;Geographical Extent and Location</h3>
                <p>The Indus Valley Civilization covered more than 1.25 million square kilometers, making it one of the largest ancient civilizations in terms of geographical area. It stretched across regions of modern-day Pakistan, parts of India's Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, and Punjab, and reached into eastern Afghanistan. The Indus River, which flows through Pakistan, played a central role in the development of the civilization by providing fertile land for agriculture and facilitating trade and transportation.</p>

                <h3>&#8594;Rediscovery and Significance</h3>
                <p>The civilization was rediscovered in the 1920s when archaeologists Sir John Marshall and Rai Bahadur Daya Ram Sahni unearthed the ruins of the cities of Harappa (in present-day Punjab, Pakistan) and Mohenjo-Daro (in Sindh, Pakistan). These findings revealed an ancient culture that rivaled other early civilizations like those in Mesopotamia and Egypt.</p>
                <p>The significance of the Indus Valley Civilization lies in its remarkable urban planning and architecture, its advanced understanding of hygiene and sanitation, and its successful trade networks that connected it to distant regions such as Mesopotamia. Although the Indus script remains undeciphered, and much about their political structure and religious practices is still unknown, the artifacts and ruins left behind offer a glimpse into their daily lives and achievements.</p>

                <h3>Advanced Urban Planning</h3>
                <p>The cities of the IVC were designed with a high level of sophistication, featuring streets laid out in a precise grid pattern and houses built from uniform, baked bricks.</p>

                <h3>Drainage Systems</h3>
                <p>One of the most impressive aspects of the IVC was its drainage system. Covered drains ran through the streets and connected to larger channels, indicating an advanced approach to public sanitation.</p>

                <h3>Agriculture and Trade</h3>
                <p>The people of the IVC were highly skilled in agriculture, growing wheat, barley, and cotton. They engaged in long-distance trade, particularly with Mesopotamia, exchanging goods such as beads, pottery, and metals.</p>

              <h3>Social and Cultural Life</h3>
              <p>Despite the lack of decipherable writing, the many seals, pottery, and figurines found across the region suggest that the civilization had a complex social hierarchy and a rich cultural life that included artistic expression and religious practices.</p>
